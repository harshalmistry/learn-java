**The Strategy pattern** define a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and make them interchangeable. 
Strategy allows the algorithm vary independently of the clients that use it.

**Principles to remember**

- Encapsulates what varies
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Program to interface, not implementation
